# SOCRadar Incident Connector for Microsoft Sentinel (Logic App)

This Azure Logic App solution automatically integrates security events from the **SOCRadar** threat intelligence platform, creating native **Incidents** directly inside your Microsoft Sentinel workspace.

## üöÄ Quick Deployment

Click the **Deploy to Azure** button below to create the Logic App and all necessary connections in a single step using the Azure Portal.

[![Deploy to Azure](https://aka.ms/deploytoazurebutton)](https://portal.azure.com/#create/Microsoft.Template/uri/https://github.com/Radargoger/socradar-sentinel-alarm-connector-api/blob/main/template.json)

## ‚öôÔ∏è Solution Architecture & Functionality

This Consumption Logic App runs on a recurrent schedule to pull new SOCRadar alerts and inject them as actionable security incidents into Microsoft Sentinel.

| Component | Function | Configuration |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Recurrence Trigger** | Starts the workflow. | Runs every **3 minutes** (Configurable) |
| **HTTP Action** | Fetches new alerts from the SOCRadar API. | Uses `start_date` parameter to only pull incidents from the last 3 minutes. |
| **Parse JSON** | Structures the incoming SOCRadar response data. | Uses the provided schema for mapping. |
| **For Each / Create Incident** | Iterates through each alert and creates a Sentinel Incident using the Managed Connector. | Maps SOCRadar fields to Sentinel Incident fields (Title, Severity, Description). |

### Field Mapping

The Logic App maps critical SOCRadar data to Sentinel Incident properties:

| SOCRadar Field | Microsoft Sentinel Incident Field |
| :--- | :--- |
| `alarm_type_details.alarm_generic_title` + `alarm_id` | **Title** (e.g., "Data Leak Alarm 12345") |
| `alarm_risk_level` | **Severity** (`High`, `Medium`, etc.) |
| `alarm_text` | **Description** |
| Hardcoded "New" | **Status** |

## üìù Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following information and resources ready before deployment:

1.  **Azure Subscription** with an active **Microsoft Sentinel** configuration.
2.  **SOCRadar API Key** (Required for the HTTP Action).
3.  **Microsoft Sentinel Workspace Path:** The full resource path for your Sentinel workspace where incidents will be created.

### Workspace Path Requirements (Critical)

The `Create_incident` action in the Logic App is hardcoded to a specific Sentinel workspace path. **You must update this during or after deployment** to match your environment.

**Example Path Structure:**

/Incidents/subscriptions/{Your-Sub-ID}/resourceGroups/{Your-RG-Name}/workspaces/{Your-Workspace-Name}

## üöÄ Deployment Steps

After clicking the "Deploy to Azure" button, you will be prompted to fill in deployment parameters:

| Parameter Name | Description | Default Value in Template |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Logic App Name** | The desired name for your Logic App. | `SocRadarToSentinelLogicApp` |
| **Location** | The Azure region to deploy the Logic App to. | `[resourceGroup().location]` |
| **Azure Sentinel Connection Name** | The name for the Managed API Connection to Sentinel. | `azuresentinel-1` |
| **Azure Sentinel Connection ID** | The existing Resource ID for your Sentinel connection (if available) or a placeholder. | *Placeholder value - **Needs Update*** |
| **Azure Sentinel Connection Resource ID** | The Managed API ID for Azure Sentinel in your region. | *Placeholder value - **Needs Update*** |

### Post-Deployment Configuration

1.  Navigate to the deployed Logic App in the Azure Portal.
2.  Open the **Logic App Designer**.
3.  **Update the HTTP Action:**
    * Find the `HTTP` step and click **Edit**.
    * In the `URI` field, locate `key=...` and replace the placeholder API key with your **actual SOCRadar API Key**.
4.  **Update the Create Incident Action:**
    * Find the `Create_incident` step and click **Edit**.
    * Verify the **Path** field contains the correct Subscription ID, Resource Group Name, and Workspace Name for your Sentinel environment.
5.  **Save** the Logic App. The workflow will now start running every 3 minutes.

## üîé Querying the Data

New SOCRadar alerts will appear as standard incidents in your Microsoft Sentinel portal.

1.  Go to **Microsoft Sentinel**.
2.  Navigate to the **Incidents** blade.
3.  You can filter by the Incident Title, which contains the unique SOCRadar alert details.

## üõë Troubleshooting

| Problem | Possible Solution |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Logic App Runs are "Failed".** | Check the Logic App's **Run History**. If the **HTTP** step fails, verify your **SOCRadar API Key** is correct. |
| **Logic App is "Succeeded" but No Incidents Appear in Sentinel.** | 1. Check the output of the **Create_incident** step for any authorization errors. 2. Verify that the `Path` field in the **Create_incident** action correctly points to your Sentinel workspace. |
| **Too many Incidents are being created.** | Adjust the `Recurrence` interval (e.g., from 3 minutes to 5 or 10 minutes) or reduce the `limit=100` parameter in the `HTTP` URI. |
